        <p>
          I&apos;m an aspiring <b>software engineer</b> currently working as a
          Data Coordinator on oncology clinical trials at Georgetown University
          Medical Center. Also, I&apos;m in my final semester pursuing a{" "}
          <b>Master&apos;s in Computer and Information Technology</b> at the{" "}
          University of Pennsylvania.
        </p>
        <p>
          Through the program, I&apos;ve gained hands-on experience with core
          computer science topics including{" "}
          <b>
            software engineering, computer systems, databases, and networked
            applications
          </b>
          . To close out the program, I&apos;m taking Machine Learning for Data
          Science and Internet and Web Systems to dive deeper into <b>AI</b> and{" "}
          <b>building scalable web apps</b>.
        </p>
        <p>
          My background blends <b>data, research, and software</b> - driven by a
          strong interest in building tools that solve real-world problems. When
          I&apos;m not coding or studying, you&apos;ll find me tinkering with my
          espresso machine, spending time with my family, or petting every dog I
          meet.
